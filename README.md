- **config** directory contains main configuration classes 
- **controller** directory contains controllers for processing requests
- **dao** directory contains classes for DB manipulating
- **dto** directory contains classes for receiving and sending data to the client side in the form of objects
- **exception** directory contains custom DataProcessingException which is thrown in case of problems in interaction with the DB
- **lib** directory contains custom annotations and validators for their processing
- **model** directory contains all DB entities
- **security** directory contains CustomUserDetailsService for providing session-term authorisation
- **service** directory contains classes for providing connection between controller and dao levels and implementation of business logic
- **util** directory contains DateTimePatternUtil for working with date type data
- **resources** directory contains db.properties file for setting connection to DB

Also, here is an internal structure of DB schema:
